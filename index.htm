          <p>
            I am a veteran developer with 15+ years of experience in web development, having led diverse teams and projects across two countries. As the founder of <a href="https://viroidgames.com" target="_blank">Viroid Games</a> since August 2020 and author of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1801816026">game development book</a> with Packt Publishing, I bring a unique blend of creative and business insights to indie game development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mentorship is a true passion of mineâ€”an inclination inherited from my parents, both educators. This has driven me to teach Low Poly Game Art at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ocadu.ca/">OCAD</a> and, more recently, launch an initiative offering hands-on workshops and consulting sessions to empower indie game developers in tackling their business and presentation needs."

                This is a point-and-click adventure game I built for the readers of my book, Game Development with
                Blender and Godot. Although really short, the game is playable and the version hosted on
                <a href="https://viroidgames.itch.io/claras-adventure" target="_blank">Itch</a> offers readers a chance to compare their own creation with what I envisioned.

                I decided to release a short game as a strategic decision soon after I founded my video game studio.
                This was so I could see how Steam worked. Originally a premium game, its price has since been changed to
                free for attracting a bigger player base. In this
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1464400/Mead_Crafter/" target="_blank">game</a>, you sell the townspeople mead in order to gain enough recognition with the aim of finally serving the
                King.

                It's always a breath of fresh air to be assigned to projects together; it's assured the project will
                meet business requirements and go the extra mile. Kumsal understands the deliverables from high-end plans, down to the detailed technical tasks. He's very skilled in planning, organizing and
                visualizing even the most complex tasks.

                Kumsal was always a pleasure to work with. Whenever the really tough questions came up, he would be the
                first person ready with the knowledge and experience to troubleshoot even the most complicated issues.
                Kumsal was much more than your average designer; he was the person who we all turned to for answers that
                no one else knew. His expertise will be a boon to any organization lucky enough to employ him.

                I worked directly with Kumsal on a large web application done in JavaScript for around three months. In
                that time he taught me how to create a JS library... There was no problem that Kumsal couldn't solve or
                a question he couldn't find an answer to. Kumsal's dedication to his work is admirable.
